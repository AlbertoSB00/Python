Description: Develop a program that enters by keyboard an age and displays a category depending on the
             age: Infancy (0-3), Toddler (4-11), Teenager (12-20), Adult (21-65), Elderly (+65). There are two ways
             to face this problem.

age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

    print("You're infancy.")
elif age >= 4 and age <= 11:
    print("You're toddler.")
elif age >= 12 and age <= 20:
    print("You're teenager.")
elif age >= 21 and age <= 65:
    print("You're adult")
elif age >= 65 and age <= 120:
    print("You're elderly")
elif age > 120:
    print("hmmm")
