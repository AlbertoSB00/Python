Description: Example of use of counter, accumulator and switches.

"""

# There are 3 types of special variables according to a specific use:
# Counter -> Integer variable. It counts how many times an event has happened.
# Accumulator -> Integer variable. It accumulates or adds different amount of something.
# Switch -> Boolean integer. It warns if an event has happened or not.

# Develop a program that enters by keyboard marks of several pupils in a subject until the mark is negative.
# Display in the screen how many of them are passed and how many are failed.
# 2nd part: Calculate the average mark for the passed pupils and for the failed ones.
