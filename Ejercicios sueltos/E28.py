Description: Develop a program that calculates and displays the factorial of a number entered by keyboard.



n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
count = n
result = 0
result1 = 0

while count >= 1:
    result = n * count
    print(f"{n} * {count} = {result}")
    result1 += result
    count -= 1
print("The result is", result1)

else:
    counter = number
    factorial = 1
