Description:    Develop a program that enter by keyboard the height and the weight of 5 people.
                The weight must be between 45 and 450 kg.
                The height must be between 1.30 and 2.30 m.
                Then, it calculates the BMI and displays on the screen.
                Besides, it shows on the screen the category according to BMI:
                    - Underweight < 18.5
                    - Normal weight 18.5 <= BMI <= 24.9
                    - Overweight 25 <= BMI <= 29.9
                    - Obesity > 30

                BMI = weight / height ** 2

                Task:
                    - Read the valid values of height and weight.      OK
                    - Calculate the BMI.                               OK
                    - Get the category of the BMI.                     OK
