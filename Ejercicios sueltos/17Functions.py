# What is a function?
# Functions are statements that are executed under demand in the program. That is, when the programmer needs, it can to
# request to execute the functions.

# What do they work for?
# Big programs can be face better if we split up problem in several task, every one of them is resolved with a function.

# What function are there?
# The language has many many functions. They are known as build in function.
# Objects (in OOP) also have function. They are called methods.
# Programmers can create new functions, call user functions.

# An advantage or function is that they can be reused in many programs. In this case, we can create module (files with
# functions) that we can use in several programs. Modular programming.

# Defining a function.
# A function has:
#   Head -> It contains the function name and the list of parameters.
#   Body -> The statements that form the function.
#   One of them can be the return statement. It returns a value to the point of the program where the function was
#   called.

# Syntax:
#   def <function name>(<par1>, <par2>, <par3>, <...>):
#       [doc string]
#       statement1
#       statement2
#       statement3
#       ...
#       return <value>

# Develop a program that calculated the length of a circumference.

# Parameters:
# Data that functions need to operate.
# In the invocation of the function it could have different values.
# There are two types of parameters:
# 1.- Formal parameter -> Is the parameter defined in the head of the function. It can only be a identifier and it
# behaves as a variable.
# 2.- Real parameter -> Also they are known as arguments. They are the values passed to the function invocation. They
# can be any valid expression (a single literal, a single variable, a more complex expression, even an invocation of
# another function)

# The number and datatype of formal parameters must match with the number and datatypes of the arguments.

# When a function is calling, there is a correspondence among the real parameters (in function head) and arguments
# (in function invocation)
# The value of each argument is copied in the respective formal parameters.
