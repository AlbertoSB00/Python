             is <bmi>, where <bmi> is the body-mass index calculated with two decimals digits.

weight = float(input("Enter your weight (in kg): "))
height = float(input("Enter your height (in metres): "))
body_mass = weight / height**2
print(f"Your body-mass index is {body_mass:{2}.{2}f}, where {body_mass:{2}.{2}f} is the body-mass index calculated "
      f"with two decimals digits.")
