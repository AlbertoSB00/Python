Description: Using the assignment operators. There area other assignment operators beside the =. They involved and
             operation and then, and assignment to a variable. They could only be used with variables, if could we used
             literal in one operand thought.
             += Addition and assignment
             -=
             *=
             /=
             //=
             %=
             **=
